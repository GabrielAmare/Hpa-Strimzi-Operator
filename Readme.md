I wrote this operator to do two things

1.) Solve an issue with Strimzi - HPA integrations.

See https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/issues/3331

2.) To Update the Kafka Kind provided with default Strimzi installation everytime an Event is generated from the HPA. This means that the number of replicas managed by the Kind Kafka will match the replicas managed by the HPA.

Email me @ sumukhballal@gmail.com for any questions/ how you can get started with Fabric 8 or use this operator in a real world scenario while scaling Kafka.
